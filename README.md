# What is Easy Events?

This application is a calendar that is password protected. Users will be able to log in and add an account to access their own personalized calendar. Users will be able to add events, delete events, and browse the calendar. When users are done adding events, they will be displayed a week view of their own events. Users will be able to add onto their calendar as well as take off any events they want.  


# Features

# Installation

**Requirements**

To install the Calendar application, make sure to have the right Java version (Java 8, jre1.8.0_221). This application will also work with newer versions of Java. You can use any IDE of your choice, but we recommend eclipse. Make sure to have JavaFX properly installed on your machine to run the application.  
If you wish to edit any interfaces or code, you can download SceneBuilder and see the fxml files.  

**Downloading and Importing**  

In the main branch, click the green code button and download the zip folder. Once the zip folder is done downloading, extract the folder into any location where you can recall. Open your IDE of choice and import the extracted folder to your project explorer.  

**Starting the application**  

Once imported, the project should be in your project explorer. Open the project and navigate to the Main.java in the src, then run the Main class. The first page prompted to you should be the login page.
